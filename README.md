# 📊 Linear regression with One Variable

This project demonstrates the basics of supervised learning using **Linear Regression with one variable**. It's a foundational concept in machine learning used to predict a numerical output based on a single input feature.

---

## 🔍 Objective

To build a simple linear regression model that learns from data and predicts outputs using one independent variable (feature).

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Load the dataset (single feature and target variable).
2. Visualize the data.
3. Implement the cost function.
4. Apply gradient descent to minimize the cost.
5. Plot the regression line on the data.
